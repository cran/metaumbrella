\usage{
forest(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \dQuote{umbrella}}

\item{...}{additional arguments that can be passed to this function}
}
\value{
In addition to the plot, the function returns a list including:
\itemize{
\item a dataset with the factors, their class and their effect size. Particularly useful when adding a column via the 'add_columns' argument to obtain the ordering of the factors in the plot. See the vignette dedicated to the forest plots for a concrete example.
\item the optimal width and height of the plot, useful when calling the function \code{pdf()} or \code{png()}.
}
}
\description{
Draw a forest plot of the factors included in an umbrella review.
}
\details{
For now, this function simply applies the \code{\link{forest.umbrella}()} function on an object of class \dQuote{umbrella}.
